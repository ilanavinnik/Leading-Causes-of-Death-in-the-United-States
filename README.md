Author: Ilana Vinnik, M.S. in Statistics
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes mortality trends in the United States from 1999 to 2017 using data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and CDC WONDER. The study focuses on the leading causes of death, highlighting persistent issues such as heart disease and cancer, while examining geographic and temporal patterns in mortality rates.
🧮 Methods
Data Source: NCHS and CDC WONDER databases
Tools Used: RStudio for statistical analysis and visualization
Visualizations:
Bar plot: Comparison of the top 10 causes of death
Choropleth map: State-level mortality distribution
Timeline plot: National mortality trends (1999–2017)
Heatmap: Decline in heart disease death rates over time
📈 Key Findings
Heart disease remains the leading cause of death, followed by cancer.
Mortality rates declined nationwide after 2005, suggesting medical and public health improvements.
Mississippi and West Virginia showed the highest death rates in 2017, indicating regional disparities.
🚀 Future Directions
Further work should focus on:
Linking mortality with socioeconomic and behavioral factors.
Exploring predictive modeling for regional health outcomes.
Extending analysis to post-2017 data for long-term trend assessment.
