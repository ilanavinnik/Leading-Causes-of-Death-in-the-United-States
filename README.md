Author: Ilana Vinnik, M.S. in Statistics
This project analyzes U.S. mortality trends from 1999–2017 using data from the CDC WONDER and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The analysis identifies heart disease and cancer as the leading causes of death and examines national and regional patterns through data visualization.
Methods:
Data were processed and visualized in RStudio, using bar charts, choropleth maps, timeline plots, and heatmaps to explore geographic and temporal trends.
Key Findings:
Heart disease remains the top cause of death.
National mortality rates declined after 2005, suggesting medical and public health improvements.
Highest death rates observed in Mississippi and West Virginia.
Future Work:
Explore socioeconomic and behavioral determinants of mortality and update with post-2017 data.
